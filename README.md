## Introduction

I'm learning Java and many other products I've never heard of. This looks to be a busy bootcamp.

Right before this line, I hit the ENTER key twice. The instructions claim that this will provide a praragraph break.

At the end of this line, I will add two spaces. Again, as claimed by the instructions, this will be interpreted as a single line break.
